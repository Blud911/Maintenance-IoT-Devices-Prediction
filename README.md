Maintenance IoT Devices Prediction

Overview

The "Maintenance IoT Devices Prediction" project focuses on predicting maintenance needs for IoT devices by using machine learning techniques. The project includes generating synthetic data, applying predictive modeling, and visualizing results through an interactive Dash dashboard.

Project Structure

1. Synthetic Data Generation
   - A script to generate synthetic IoT device data, including features like Device_ID, Device_Type, Model, Location, Installation_Date, Date Device_Age_Days, Errors.

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Data cleaning and feature engineering steps, including merging datasets, handling missing values, and feature scaling.

3. Predictive Modeling
   - Building and training machine learning models to predict maintenance needs. 
   - Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Dashboard Creation
   - An interactive Dash application to visualize device health, anomaly alerts, failure predictions, and historical data.

Features

- Synthetic Data Generation: Creates a realistic dataset for IoT devices with features like Device_ID, Device_Type, Model, Location, Installation_Date, Date Device_Age_Days, Errors.
- Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning models to predict maintenance needs based on historical data.
- Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes device health status, anomaly alerts, failure predictions, and historical data.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Anaconda
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `plotly`
  - `dash`
  - `dash-bootstrap-components`

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maintenance-iot-devices-prediction.git
   cd maintenance-iot-devices-prediction
   ```

2. Create a conda environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   conda create --name iot-prediction python=3.12
   conda activate iot-prediction
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Running the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the `dashboard` directory:

   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   ```

2. Run the Dash app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8050` to view the dashboard.

Usage

- Synthetic Data Generation: Run the `synthetic_ioT_device.csv.py` script to create a synthetic dataset.
- Predictive Modeling: Use the `IoT_Device_Maintenance.py` script to train and evaluate models.
- Dashboard: Interact with the Dash app to visualize and explore device health, anomaly alerts, and failure predictions.
